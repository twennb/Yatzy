# Yatzy

A Yatzy score sheet, the top half at least..

Features columns for up to four players' scores, automatically updates each player's summed score and shows the bonus points if achieved!

# Two versions
the Yatzy project was quickly thrown together and not completely functional, the Alternate project is more polished and should be fully functional with minimal bugs. Don't enter letters for the scores..

# How to use:
Clone the project and run in Visual Studio.
Enter player names at the top of each column.
Enter each player's score for each category in the box and press Enter to update.
